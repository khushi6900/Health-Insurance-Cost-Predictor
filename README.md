## Introduction
Health insurance costs are influenced by a variety of factors, including demographics, lifestyle choices, and geographical location. Predicting these costs accurately is essential for insurance companies to effectively manage risk and set appropriate premiums. This project aims to build a predictive model that can estimate health insurance costs based on individual characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about individuals, including their age, sex, BMI, smoking habits, region, and the corresponding health insurance charges. It is important to preprocess the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features before training the model.

## Methods
Several machine learning algorithms will be explored for this task, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and possibly more advanced techniques such as gradient boosting. The performance of each model will be evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared.

## Results
The performance of each model will be presented, showcasing their accuracy in predicting health insurance costs.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Preprocess the dataset.
Train the model using the desired algorithm.
Evaluate the model's performance.
